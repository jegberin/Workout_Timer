Build a Static Workout Timer Web App using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
​1. UI and Layout:
​Create a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly interface with a dark mode workout aesthetic.
​Display two large, highly visible timers:
​Main Timer: The current 3-minute interval countdown (format: MM:SS).
​Total Session Timer: The overall 45-minute countdown (format: MM:SS).
​Below the timers, include three large, easily tappable buttons: "Start", "Pause", and "Stop".
​2. Core Logic:
​Interval Timer: Starts at 3:00 (180 seconds) and counts down to 0.
​Looping: When the interval timer hits 0, it should immediately reset to 3:00 and continue counting down without requiring user input.
​Total Timer: Starts at 45:00 (2700 seconds) and counts down continuously whenever the interval timer is running.
​End of Workout: When the Total Timer reaches 0:00, stop the interval timer completely and display a "Workout Complete!" message.
​Button Functions:
​Start: Begins or resumes both countdowns.
​Pause: Freezes both countdowns at their current times.
​Stop: Resets the interval timer to 3:00 and the total timer to 45:00, pausing all action.
​3. Audio and Voice Prompts (Crucial):
​Use the native window.speechSynthesis API for all voice announcements so no external audio files are needed.
​At exactly 2:00 remaining on the interval timer, use speech synthesis to say: "Two minutes to go."
​At exactly 1:00 remaining on the interval timer, use speech synthesis to say: "One minute to go."
​At 0:05, 0:04, 0:03, 0:02, and 0:01 remaining, use speech synthesis to count down: "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "One".
​The Buzzer: When the interval timer hits 0:00, use the native Web Audio API (AudioContext) to generate a loud, 1-second buzzer/beep sound. Do NOT use external MP3 or WAV files for the buzzer.
​4. Edge Cases:
​Ensure the timers do not drift or speed up if the user clicks "Start" multiple times.
​Add a small note on the UI reminding the user to click "Start" to enable audio permissions, as browsers require a user interaction before playing audio.
